# Matrix-lib

This repository is used to reinforce my Linear Algebra, working on examples of what you are learning in any mathematical field would probably yield the most in assisting you to grasp the subject on a deeper level. However, I'm trying to go through it another way, by mixing two fields I'm trying to learn, I thought I should experiment on building a matrix calculator. I will start with some basic functionality and slowly expand its abilites and provide a plan, I don't exactly have an idea of what I am going to be doing in this project.
